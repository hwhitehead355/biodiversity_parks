# Biodiversity in National Parks
This project was completed as part of the Codecademy 'Data Science Foundations' course.<br>

I explore data from the National Parks Service, and investigate whether there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered.<br>

More importantly, I start my GitHub portfolio and showcase my skills in:
+ data cleansing
+ data exploration
+ hypothesis testing
+ visualisation

## Requirements
The project is presented in Jupyter Notebook and the following packages are required:
+ pandas
+ numpy
+ seaborn
+ matplotlib
+ scipy.stats
